# Eclipse Asciidoctor Plug-in

This is a personal project that provides some simple plug-ins that do some
very specific things. In part, content provided here is intended to be consumed
as examples of what you can do with the Eclipse IDE. Over time, these plug-ins
may evolve and become more generally useful.

In a manner of speaking, at least some of these plug-ins demonstrate how the
Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) can be used to effectively "script"
the development environment. The PDE is included in the Eclipse IDE for
Committers, or can be added via the "Help > Install new software..." option in your
Eclipse IDE.
